## üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed:

-   An application using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
-   In this application it is possible to play a color guessing game where:
    -   Within a range of colors, the player must try to guess which color was randomly selected as the right color;
    -   The color palette is presented by colored circles;
    -   There is a button to start and restart the game;
    -   When selecting a color, a text should inform whether or not you got the correct color.
